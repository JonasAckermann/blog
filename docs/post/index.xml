      <description>Typically, when programming with Scala I use a combination of ensime in emacs, sbt and the Scala repl. However, sometimes when working on a new project which requires a lot of data exploration and graphics it is sometimes more useful to have a notebook where figures are rendered inline with descriptions of why each figure has been generated and what it shows for future reference. Jupyter notebooks have long been the standard in Python (although I prefer rmarkdown and knitr when using R).</description>

      <description>Area Results Download the results from Power of ten for northern, midlands, southern and national.
 A linear model The goal is to fit a model, where the outcome is the position at the national and the input is the position at the northern XC. This then allows us to determine the quality of the field at each XC and determine what position you are likely to finish in the National this season given a result in the area championships.</description>

      <title>Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo in R with Rcpp</title>

      <description>Bivariate Normal Model This post considers how to implement a simple Metropolis scheme to determine the parameter posterior distribution of a bivariate Normal distribution. The implementation is generic, using higher-order-functions and hence can be re-used with new algorithms by specifying the un-normalised log-posterior density and a proposal distribution for the parameters. The built-in parallel package is used fit multiple chains in parallel, finally the Metropolis algorithm is reimplemented in C++ using Rcpp which seemlessly integrates with R.</description>

      <description>The Harrier League is a cross country running league with seven fixtures across the North East of England in the 2017/18 season across the winter months from September ’17 until March ‘18.
The Harrier League is unique to other cross country fixtures because the senior runners are divided up into slow, medium and fast packs. In the senior men’s race, the slow runners start first followed 2 minutes 30 seconds later by the medium pack runners, then a further 2 minutes 30 seconds by the fast pack runners.</description>

      <title>MCMC with Scala Breeze</title>

      <description>Bivariate Gaussian Model Scala Breeze is a numerical computing library, which also provides facilities for statistical computing. For instance, implementations of distributions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for, typically used for Bayesian inference of intractable models. Today I am going to build a simple bivariate Gaussian model, simulate some realisations from the model and use the Breeze library to recover the mean of the bivariate Gaussian distribution and the variance.</description>

      <description>There are many sources of open data on the web, freely accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API) made available over the web. A common interchange format for these APIs is Javascript Object Notation (JSON) which is human readable and predictable, however is not in the correct format for analysis. The data needs to be parsed from the JSON string and made available as an object we can work with.</description>

      <title>Using Monads for Handling Failures and Exceptions</title>

      <description>In this post I will give a practical introduction to some useful structures for handling failure in functional programming.
Referential Transparency One of the most important properties of functional programming is referential transparency and programming with pure functions. This means we can substitute a pure function with its result, for intance if we have the function def f = 1 + 2, we can replace every occurence of f with 3 and the final evaluation will remain unchanged</description>

      <title>Seasonal DLM</title>

      <description>The Seasonal DLM I introduced the class of state space models called DLMs in a previous post covering the Kalman Filter. The seasonal DLM is similar to the first order DLM, however it incorporates a deterministic transformation to the state, in order to capture cyclic trends. Remember a general DLM can be written as:
\[\begin{align} y_t &amp;amp;= F_t x_t + \nu_t, \qquad \mathcal{N}(0, V_t), \\ x_t &amp;amp;= G_t x_{t-1} + \omega_t, \quad \mathcal{N}(0, W_t).</description>

      <title>The Kalman Filter in Scala</title>

      <description>A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) is a special type of state space model, where the state and observation equations are Normally distributed and linear. A general DLM can be written as follows:
\[\begin{aligned} y_t &amp;amp;= F_t x_t + \nu_t, \qquad \nu_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, V_t) \\ x_t &amp;amp;= G_tx_{t-1} + \omega_t \qquad \omega_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, W_t), \end{aligned}\]
\(y_t\) represents the observation of the process at time \(t\), \(x_t\) is the value of the unobserved state at time \(t\).</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Akka Streaming</title>

      <description>Akka Streaming is a streaming IO engine used to build high performance, fault tolerant and scalable streaming data services. In this post I will describe how you can implement some of the features included in Akka Streaming using only simple streams of integers and strings, although the true power of Akka streams only becomes apparent when we are consuming data from real sources such as Websockets, databases and files. Akka is available in Java and Scala, but I will be focusing on the Scala API in this post.</description>

      <title>Scala HMC</title>

      <description>Scala implementation To implement HMC, first identify the individual components of the algorithm and write them as referentially transparent functions. The first step is to sample the momentum, \(\phi\) from the prior distribution, chosen to be a standard multivariate Normal distribution of dimension \(m\):
% The prior distribution of \(\phi\) represented by the function \lstinline{priorPhi} can be sampled from and the log-pdf can be calculated. The prior distribution can have a general covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) to replace the \(m\) dimensional identity matrix \(I_m\).</description>
