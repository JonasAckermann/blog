      <description>In this post I will give a practical introduction to some useful structures for handling failure in functional programming.
Referential Transparency One of the most important properties of functional programming is referential transparency and programming with pure functions. This means we can substitute a pure function with its result, for intance if we have the function def f = 1 + 2, we can replace every occurence of f with 3 and the final evaluation will remain unchanged</description>

      <description>A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) is a special type of state space model, where the state and observation equations are Normally distributed and linear. A general DLM can be written as follows:
\[\begin{aligned} y_t &amp;amp;= F_t x_t + \nu_t, \qquad \nu_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, V_t) \\ x_t &amp;amp;= G_tx_{t-1} + \omega_t \qquad \omega_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, W_t), \end{aligned}\]
\(y_t\) represents the observation of the process at time \(t\), \(x_t\) is the value of the unobserved state at time \(t\).</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Akka Streaming</title>

      <description>Akka Streaming is a streaming IO engine used to build high performance, fault tolerant and scalable streaming data services. In this post I will describe how you can implement some of the features included in Akka Streaming using only simple streams of integers and strings, although the true power of Akka streams only becomes apparent when we are consuming data from real sources such as Websockets, databases and files. Akka is available in Java and Scala, but I will be focusing on the Scala API in this post.</description>
