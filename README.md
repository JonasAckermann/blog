# Blog

This is where I keep the code required to build my blog and any additional code described in those posts. See the latest posts at https://jonnylaw.rocks.

There is also a [companion R package](https://github.com/jonnylaw/jonnylaw/).

This blog is built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) in R and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
