Jonathan Law is a current PhD student on the [Cloud Computing for Big Data CDT](http://www.bigdata-cdt.ac.uk/), funded by the [EPSRC](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk). His primary research interest is in using functional programming for Bayesian Inference (often called probabilistic programming), using the language [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). Prior to embarking on the PhD, he worked in industry as an Insight Analyst, extracting value from large customer data sets.
